# Vishnu Vardhan Burri - Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, proudly crafted by me, **Vishnu Vardhan Burri**, a **Full-Stack Developer**, **AI in Cybersecurity Enthusiast**, and **Coding & Math Tutor**. This project is a testament to my skills, showcasing my journey, expertise, and passion for building secure, intelligent digital systems. I designed and developed this sleek, dark-themed site from the ground up, blending modern web technologies with a futuristic aesthetic.

## Overview

I created this single-page application using **React.js** as the foundation, styled it with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and vibrant dark theme, and added smooth animations with **Framer Motion**. The portfolio features a custom hero section with my photo, a dynamic navigation bar, and particle effects (via tsparticles) for a cyberpunk vibe. I integrated **EmailJS** for the contact form and deployed it on **Vercel**, leveraging its auto-generated image capabilities for the project gallery.

### Features
